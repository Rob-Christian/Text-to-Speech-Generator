# Text to Speech Generator
This project demonstrates how to implement a text-to-speech (TTS) system using the Transformers library. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide for setting up and running a TTS pipeline that converts input text into synthetic speech.
## Features
1. Text-to-Speech Conversion: Converts user-provided text into audio using a pre-trained TTS model.
2. Device Optimization: Automatically detects and utilizes GPU (if available) for faster processing.
3. Interactive Playback: Includes functionality to play generated audio directly within the notebook.
## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip: "pip install transformers torch ipython"
3. Ensure a compatible GPU is available if intending to leverage GPU acceleration.
